# Live Stream - Let's Build An HTML Website Together

In this live tutorial, we will be building out a full HTML website using HTML, CSS, and JS. This website can be used as a single portfolio or for a full-fledged agency. Once the live stream is complete, I will provide the full source code but in the mean time, join me live and watch me code a full website from start to finish.  The entire process may take 2-3 hours (it actually took 4.5 hours lol) so you have plenty of time to jump on and ask questions if you need to.
